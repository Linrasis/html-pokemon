# html-pokemon
a pokemon style html game, built with AngularJS and Ionic

# Why?
  It is one of my dream to create a pokemon like game with my own scenarios and monsters. Finally I had a chance!
  The reason I use AngularJS instead of other professional game creator framework is that I love it...
# How?
Moving
  Instead of creating dynamically reading from images with <canvas>, I directly export pngs from Tiled Maps and use javascript to move the background and define blocks.
  The downside is that the map is limited to a small area (you can move all along the map in pokemon). Howver,the beautiful transition with Angular UI makes the transition between maps quite easy, it is even based on URLS!


# What do I want at last?
Just write pure JSON and make maps through tiled maps, and you create your own game!

# What we have now
- Movements
- Map transitions
- Dialogs

# TODO
- Menu
- Save system
- EnemySystem
- PokeMon system
- Battle system

# To be continued
